# rrm_alpha Installers

Flutter supports multiple platform targets. Flutter based apps can run
native on Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as directly
in a browser from the web. Flutter functionality is essentially
identical across all platforms so the experience across different
platforms will be very similar.
